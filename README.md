I found papercss (see references) a less formal and more childish ðŸ‘¶ css library, and wanted to build something with it and here comes trelloForKids.

### Api

the api is built with nodejs, expressjs

### Front

Built with react, as a build tool I configured a minimalist config with wepback

### Start services
to run the app, you need first to install docker on your machine, then run
```
docker-compose up
```

to build the app
```
docker-compose build
```
