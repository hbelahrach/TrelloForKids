I found papercss (see references) a less formal and more childish ðŸ‘¶ css library, and wanted to build something with it and here comes trelloForKids.

### Api

the api is built with nodejs, expressjs

###### to start the server:
```
yarn start
```

###### debug:
```
yarn debug
```

###### to run tests:
```
yarn test
```

### Front
Built with react, as a build tool I configured a minimalist config with wepback

###### to start the server:
```
yarn start
```
